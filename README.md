- Hello! My name is Brianna Taborda, and I'm interested in AI and Data Analytics.
- I'm proficient in C++, have moderate knowledge of Python, and a foundational understanding of Java from high school.
- Over the past year, I've had the ability to start learning and working with React, HTML, and CSS to develop websites for a club at my school and a side project that many Tufts students are collaborating on. We're all really excited and motivated, and I can't wait to share more updates as development proceeds.
- Fun facts about me:
1. I hate cheese, but I love pizza and mac'n cheese
2. I've been blessed to be able to travel to many countries and intend on continuing to do so. (When I studied abroad in London, I made 45 posts documenting my days and travels, and really loved sharing them with my 20 consistent likers!) My favorite country so far has been Morocco, and specifically Madrid, Spain, which was helped by the fact that I speak Spanish.
3. I love to read historical fiction, post-apocalyptic novels, and novels such as "A Little Life" by Hanya Yanigihara (I did not cry!). My favorite book is "Who Fears Death" by Nnedi Okorafor
4. Last but not least, I love staying active. Growing up, I did gymnastics and swimming, switched to softball, and now in college, I've been a cheerleader for all four years and have enjoyed throwing and catching people in the air. I go to the gym pretty regularly and will always offer to kill my friend's abs and yell at them if they don't finish a set.
